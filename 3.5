STEP 1: Let E^R = an empty adjacency list of length |V|
# This step takes O(V)

STEP 2: For all vertices u in V, examine the neighbors of u.

STEP 3: For each neighbor v of u, add u as a neighbor of v.
# STEPS 2 and 3 takes O(|V| + |E|) because we are examining all the edges and vertices once.

STEP 4: Return E^R

Correctness:
We are guaranteed to go through each vertex u in V and all the outgoing edges of the vertices.
This holds even if we don't have a connected graph.

This is because graphs (not reverse graphs) are mapped via outgoing edges in the adjacency list representation.
We are bound to reverse all the edges correctly by examining all the individual vertices.

Time complexity:
O(|V|) + O(|V| + |E|) = O(|V| + |E|)
