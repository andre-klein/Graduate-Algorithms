Ordered by Post: C J F H I G D A E B

A) {C D F J} {G H I} {A} {E} {B}

B) Source SCC have no incoming edges => {A}, {B}
Sink SCC have no outgoing edges => {C D F J}

D) We need to add edges from sink to source
First we add an edge from sink to {E}
Then we add an edge from sink to {B}

Second Graph:
A)

B)
