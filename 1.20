inverse of 20 mod 79 => clearly 4

inverse of 3 mod 62 => clearly 21

inverse of 21 mod 91:
GCD(21, 91) = GCD(21, 7) = GCD(7, 0) = 7
Inverse doesn't exist because GCD(91,21) != 1

inverse of 5 mod 23:
Use extended-euclid:

Ext-Euclid(23, 5) => EE(5, 3) => EE(3, 2) => EE(2, 1) => EE(1, 0)
(1, 2, -9) <= (1, -1, 2) <= (1, 1, -1) <= (1, 0, 1) <= (1, 1, 0)

1 = 2*23 -9*5
Therefore, the inverse of 5 mod 23 is 23-9 = 14
