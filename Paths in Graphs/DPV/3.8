A)
* Model the graph problem s.t. the vertices represent the volume of liquid in containers.

* Let the tuple (a1, a2, a3) contain the volume of liquid in containers S1, S2, S3
Where S1 is the container with volume 10, S2 the container with volume 7, and S3 the container with volume 4.

* The start vertex is (0, 7, 4) since S1 is empty in the beginning

* The three containers combined will have 11 pints of water. That is, a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 11

* In addition, none of the containers can have more water than their volume. That is, 0 <= a_1 <= 10, 0 <= a_2 <= 7, and 0 <= a_3 <= 4

* Note that the graph construction takes a lot more time than running DFS in part B.

* The directed edges of the graph indicate possible state transitions. Therefore, only two vertices change during transitions.
The 3rd being left the same since we're only pouring from container into another.

* Let i and j indicate two different coordinates. Either b_i or b_j is 0 after the pouring.
Or b_i or b_j are equal to the container volume (S_i or S_j).

* Our test is to find if there is a path from vertex (0, 7, 4) to (*, 2, *) or (*, *, 2).

By the way, in order to build this graph, we can have at most 6 outgoing edges by pouring from container 1 to 2 or 3.
Or starting from 2 or starting from 3.

B)

STEP 1: We run explore for directed graphs with the graph G that we constructed in part A.
STEP 2: Return true if we reach (*, 2, *) or (*, *, 2).
STEP 3: Else return false.

Correctness:
Explore on directed graph is guaranteed to find all reachable path from (0, 7, 4).
If explore finishes without finding (*, 2, *) or (*, *, 2), it means those vertices are not reachable from (0, 7, 4)
and no sequence of pourings exists.

Time complexity:
Explore takes O(|V| + |E|)
