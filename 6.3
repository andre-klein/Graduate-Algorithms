# Pure DP solution
# recurrence: Let L(i) = max profit up to index i s.t. 0 <= i <= n
# base case: L[0] = 0
# subproblem: L(i) = maxj(L[j] + pi, L[i-1])
# pseudocode:
# L[0] = 0
# for i = 1 to n:
#   L[i] = 0
#   for j = 0 to i - 1:
#     L[i] = max(L[j] + pi, L[i-1])
# return L[i]

# Note that this problem can also be done with D&C
