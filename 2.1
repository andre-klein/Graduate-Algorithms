Multiply X = 10011011 and Y = 10111010 using divide & conquer

Equation:
A = FastMultiply(XL,YL)
B = FastMultiply(XR,YR)
C = FastMultiply(XL+XR, YL+YR)
Z = 2^n * A + 2^[n/2] * (C-A-B) + B

Solution:
XL = 1001 = 9
XR = 1011 = 11

YL = 1011 = 11
YR = 1010 = 10

A = 99
B = 110
C = 420
n = 8

Z = 256 * 99 + 16 * (420 - 110 - 99) + 110 = 28830

Please note that this solution is only one layer of recursion but it's not easy to do more by hand.
