N = 35
P = 7
Q = 5

PHI(N) = (7-1)(5-1) = 24

GCD(4,35) = 1
GCD(9,35) = 1

1536/24 = 64
4824/24 = 201

4^1536 = (4^24)^64 which is congruent to 1 mod 35
9^4824 = (9^24)^201 which is congruent to 1 mod 35

Therefore, we have a and b both congruent to congruent to 1 mod 35
a = 35x + 1
b = 35y + 1
a - b = 35(x-y) + 1 - 1 = 35(x-y)
Let z = x-y
35z mod 35 = 0

Therefore, the answer is.
