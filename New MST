Assume simple graph
We have a graph G and MST T
G` = G - (u,v)
T = T1 + T2 + (u,v)
E` = E - (u,v)

********************************
Algorithm:
STEP 1: Let T1 and T2 be the two trees we have left after deleting the edge (u,v)
We can find T1 by running explore algorithm for undirected graphs starting with u


STEP 2: Let E` = E - (u,v) 

Traverse the edges of E` and see if there is any edge between T1 and T2.
How can we do that? We loop
