Subproblem:
Let L[i] = length of BCS which includes ai s.t. 0 <= i <= n

Base case:
L[0] = 0

Recurrence:
L[i] = 1 + max_j(L[j]) s.t. 0 <= j < i <= n and |ai - aj| < 73

Pseudocode:
L[0] = 0
for i = 1 to n:
  L[i] = 1
  for j = 1 to i-1:
    if |ai - aj| < 73:
      L[i] = max[L[i], L[j] + 1)

return max(L)

Time complexity:
O(n^2)
