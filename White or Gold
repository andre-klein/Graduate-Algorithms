A)
STEP 1: Create a copy of G with all the white edges discarded and call it G^Gold
This STEP takes O(|E|) time if we delete edges and O(|V|+|E|) if we construct a new graph
^ means superscript

STEP 2: Create a copy of G with all the gold edges discarded and call it G^White
Now we have two graphs with only white and gold edges.

STEP 3: Run the explore algorithm for undirected graphs on the two graphs starting with vertex s

STEP 4: If s and t are in the same connected component in either graph (G^Gold or G^White), return True.
That is, we return True if explore finds t after we removed the edges of one color.
Otherwise, return False

Correctness:
This algorithm is correct because a path between s and t exists iff s and t are in the same connected component.
That is, explore(s) finds t.

Time Complexity:
O(|V| + |E|) to create a new graph or O(|E|) to just delete the edges
This is done once for each color.
O(|V| + |E|) for explore(s) on each graph to find t
This is done once for each color
O(|V|+|E|) + O(|V|+|E|) + O(|V|+|E|) + O(|V|+|E|)= O(|V|+|E|)

***************************************
B)
We'll be using G^Gold and G^White from STEP A
STEP 1: Run the explore algorithm for undirected graphs on G^White starting with s and note all the vertices reachable from s
STEP 2: Run the explore algorithm for undirected graphs on G^Gold starting with t and note all the vertices reachable from t
STEP 3: If there is any common vertex, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Correctness:
What we are doing here is as follows. Find all the vertices we can reach from s using only white edges.
Then, find if any of those vertices are reachable from t using gold edges.
A path between s and t that satisfies the requirement of having white edges followed by gold edges
exists iff those vertices exist in both of the resultant connected components in STEPS 1 & 2.

Time Complexity:
O(|V| + |E|) to create a new graph or O(|E|) to just delete the edges
This is done once for each color.
O(|V| + |E|) for explore on each graph starting from s and t
This is done once for each color
O(|V|+|E|) + O(|V|+|E|) + O(|V|+|E|) + O(|V|+|E|)= O(|V|+|E|)
