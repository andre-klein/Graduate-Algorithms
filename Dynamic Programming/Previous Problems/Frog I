Let T(i) = number of ways to reach rock i<=n

T(i) = 1 for i<=4, we give rene credit for being there and acknowledge that
we can reach 1 through 4 in only one way by making small jumps
T(i) = T(i-4) + T(i-1) for i>=5

pseudocode

for i = 1 to 4:
	T(i) = 4

for i = 5 to n:
	T(i) = T(i-4) + T(i-1)

return T(n)

O(n)
