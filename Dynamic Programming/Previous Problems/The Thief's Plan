Case 1: p = [$20, $100, $30].
Case 2: p = [$40, $30, $10, $60].
Cannot do adjacent houses

******************************************

Subproblem:
Let K(i) = max profit up to house i for 0 <= i <= n

Base case:
K(0) = 0
K(1) = p_1

Recurrence:
K[i] = max(K[i-1], K[i-2] + p_i)
Where 2 <= i <= n

Pseudocode:
K[0] = 0
K[1] = p_1

for i = 2 to n: # O(n)
    K(i) = max(K[i-1], K[i-2] + p_i)

return K(n)

Time complexity:
O(n)
