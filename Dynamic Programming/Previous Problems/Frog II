Let T(i,j) = number of ways to reach column j<=n and row i<=n

T(0,.) = T(.,0) = 0 to avoid errors in calculations
T(1,.) = T(.,1) = 0 since we can't reach those rocks except the one below
T(1,1) = 1 we give rene credit for being there

T(i,j) = T(i-2, j-1) + T(i-1, j-2) for 2<=i,j<=n

pseudocode

for i = 0 to n:
	T(0,i) = 0
	T(i,0) = 0
	T(1,i) = 0
	T(i,1) = 0

T(1,1) = 1

for i = 2 to n:
	for j = 2 to n:
		T(i,j) = T(i-2, j-1) + T(i-1, j-2)

return T(n,n)

O(n^2)
