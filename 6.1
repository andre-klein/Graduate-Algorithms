# Subproblem:
# Let L[i] = max substring (or contiguous subsequence) sum in a subset of S ending exactly at index i s.t. 0 <= i <= n
# Recurrence:
# Base case: L[0] = 0
# L[i] = max(L[i-1] + ai, 0)
# pseudocode
# L[0] = 0
# curMax = 0
# for i = 1 to n:
#   L[i] = max(L[i-1] + a_i, 0)
#   curMax = max(curMax, L[i]
# return curMax
# Time complexity is O(n)
